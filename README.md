# Within Host Model describing immune response dynamics 
### Spleen model 
Modelling within host dynamics of spleen in chickens that are infected with MDV. Trying to decipher PBL dynamics by matching data referenced **Payne & Rennie 1976**   

* match PBL data
* Do likelihood analysis
  
Focusing on PBL data because, it is the initial source of virus that abruptly affects other compartments.
